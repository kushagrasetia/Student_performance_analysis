# Student_performance_analysis
In this project I have analyse the performance of students in ETE/ETP using clustering algorithm using Bachelor Of Technology in compute science Engineering of Lovely Professional University. Basically i have followed these steps in this project:-

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Label Encoding
3. Normalization
4. KMeans clustering-k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
